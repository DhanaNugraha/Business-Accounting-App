1. Tauri Integration
The project is currently a web React app. It needs Tauri setup to become a desktop app with SQLite access.
2. Database Schema & Seed
Thereâ€™s no actual SQLite schema or seed data file yet.
We need to add:
Schema migration (accounts, transactions, etc.)
Seed data for accounts and sample transactions
3. SQLite Client Integration
The db client is a stub. For real functionality:
Use tauri-plugin-sql (recommended for Tauri)
Or use Drizzle/Prisma if targeting Node.js backend
Wire up 
ReportService
 to the real DB
4. Navigation & UI
Only the Reports page exists. Add:
Navigation (React Router)
Pages for managing accounts, transactions, settings, etc.
UI polish for a desktop feel


Polish the UI for a desktop feel after navigation/pages are in place.
